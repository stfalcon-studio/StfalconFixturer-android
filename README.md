# Stfalcon Fixturer

A Utility for developers and QAs which helps minimize time wasting on writing the same data for testing over and over again.
You can write fixture in XML one time and use it for build testing. The library can autofill EditText with your fixture data.

Where the `latest_version` is the value from JitPack.io.

### Usage

Create xml file in raw directory of app resources.
Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<fixtures>
    <fixture tag="email" group="account">
        <item>user1@user.com</item>
        <item>user2@user.com</item>
        <item>test@test.com</item>
    </fixture>
    <fixture tag="password" group="account">
        <item>qwerty123</item>
        <item>qwertyQWE</item>
        <item>11111111</item>
    </fixture>
    <fixture tag="name">
        <item>John</item>
        <item>Julia</item>
        <item>Bobby</item>
    </fixture>
    <fixture tag="address">
        <item>108 Greenwich Street, 4/F</item>
        <item>156 William Street</item>
        <item>Proskurivska Street, 11</item>
    </fixture>
</fixtures>
```
All `fixture` require `tag` attribute. This tag will be used for binding input fields to fixture.
Also you can put some fixtures in groups. For example `email` and `password` can be marked as group `account`. This two fixtures must have the same item count. And in this case where we will select one fixture from group, it will automatically put data to all bound EditTexts to the same grouped fixtures.

To initialize library you have to add this line to your Application `onCreate` method:  
```kotlin
class SampleApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        StfalconFixturer.init(this, R.raw.fixtures)
    }
}
```
First parameter it's your Application context.
Second - resource ID of you fixtures XML file.
The default behavior is Fixturer works only for debug builds. But if you want to change this behavior you can pass Boolean flag as third parameter.

After that you can bind your EditTexts to the fixtures in your activity(fragment) classes.

Kotlin:
```kotlin
loginEmailEt.setFixtureTag("email")
```
Java:
```java
StfalconFixturer.get().bindEditText(loginEmailEt, "email")
```
Where `loginEmailEt` is EditText and "email" is tag of the fixture.

Run your application and look on magic :) You can call fixtures dialog by triple tap on bound to fixture EditText.
